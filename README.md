# Kalman filter visualisation


Welcome! This repo contains a React project for a pedagogical introduction to the Kalman filter. Check it out at https://unimelb-nsgw.github.io/kalman-filter-viz/. 


If you just want to learn about Kalman filtering, click the link and ignore everything else below. What follows are instructions for running the app locally, making changes, and deploying updates.


---

## üì¶ Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**  
   Run this once after cloning the repo:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**  
   This runs the app locally with hot reloading:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the port shown) in your browser.

---

## üõ† Making Changes

- Edit React components inside the `src/` folder.
- The app will automatically reload when you save changes.
- Use consistent code formatting. (Optional: run `npm run lint` or `npm run format` if available.)

## üöÄ Deploying to Production

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Only deploy from the `main` branch to avoid accidentally pushing unfinished changes to production.

### ‚úÖ Deployment Steps
1. **Switch to the `main` branch and pull the latest changes:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   ```

2. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This creates optimized static files in the `dist/` folder.

3. **Deploy the build:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   This will publish the contents of `dist/` to the `gh-pages` branch, updating the live site.

## üí° Notes and Best Practices

- **Test your changes locally** (`npm run dev`) before building or deploying.
- **Deploy from `main` only** ‚Äî this ensures only reviewed, production-ready code goes live.
- If you‚Äôre on a feature branch, merge your changes into `main` first before deploying:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature/your-branch
   git push
   ```
- If you run into issues, check `package.json` scripts or open an issue.
